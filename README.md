# Big-Data-Project-X
Big Data Project

In order to run each of the Notebooks, make sure to edit the string containing the file path to the original dataset, so that it correpsonds to the file path of the dataset in YOUR directory. Specifically, this is the value in the "datafile" variable. The original datasets are available in the Data_Sources folder in the github repo. Additonally, ensure that the string for the output file path is edited so that it uses YOUR directory. Specifically, this is the string in the last line of the notebook where the "to_csv" function is called.

There is a folder call data_collection which contains all of the code which we used to get the EPA Air Quality data using APIs. There is a separate README in that file. 

There is also a file called instructions which outlines how to reproduce the cleaned energy consumption data. 

There is also a folder that contains the cleaned and wrangled datasets, just for reference. 

Finally, there is a .pdf with the report describing this project.
